# Getting Started With R 
## Creating and Plotting Objects 
Below is a fully labelled plot of objects "x" and "y". The points are represented by squares and connected by a blue dotted line.

## Creating a More Complicated Plot while also creating and then using a Data Frame
Below is a fully labelled plot where squares are used to represent locations of "dwellings", smaller circles are used to represent "small trees", and larger circles are used to represent "large trees".
