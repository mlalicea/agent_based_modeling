# Project 1

## Geometric Bar Plot

Plot 1, *Bhutan in 2019*, consists of two subplots. On the left, plot 1 contains a map of Bhutan's adm1 subdivisions. Each subdivision is colored according to its population size and labelled with its name and population density.
On the right, plot 1 uses a bar plot to again illustrate the population size of each Bhutan adm1 subdivision. The x-axis represents population size and the y-axis marks each subdivision. The bars are labelled with the percentage of the total population and colored to represent population size.

Plot 2, *Population of Bhutan in 2019 Subdivided by ADM2*, is a bar plot of the population of Bhutan broken down by adm2. The x-axis represents population size and the y-axis marks each adm1 subdivision. Each bar on the plot is subdivided by the adm2s that are found within the adm1. The size of the adm2s reflect the proportion of the population that lives in the area.

### Analysis:
Information from both plot 1 and 2 led me to focus on the subdivision of Chhukha. Plot 1 demonstrated that the two highest population areas in the country were the adm1s Thimphu and Chhukha. The bar plot revealed that both areas had a population of around or just above 100,000 people, which was the target population for my chosen subdivision. This dictated my decision to choose a subdivision that was an adm1, as opposed to an adm2. To decide between Chhukha and Thimphu, I used plot 2. Plot 2 revealed that while Thimphu has the higher population, most of its population is concentrated in one adm2 subdivision. After some research, I discovered that this was because the adm1 Thimphu holds the country's capital, also named Thimphu. Chhukha's population, on the other hand, is more evenly distributed across its adm2s. I believed that this distribution of the population across the division would allow me to map more defacto settlements than I could in densly populated Thimphu. My decision to focus on Chhukha was confirmed by the map in plot 1. The map showed that Chhukha borders India. Research revealed that Chhukha has the only border crossing that accepts foreign nationals in Bhutan. I believed that this would allow me to successfully model movement across the area. 

## Defacto Settlement Boundaries

Plot 3, *Access to Health Care in Chhukha, Bhutan*, is a map of Chhukha, an adm1 subdivision of Bhutan. Inside the map are the 11 main settlements in Chhukha, represented by the dark gold regions. Within each settlement there is a dot that's size illustrates the population of the settlement and that's color represents the denisty of the population.

### Analysis:
The map demonstrates 11 defacto settlements. The largest settlement is in the southwest corner of the division. This region borders India and contains the only border crossing in Bhutan that accepts foreign nationals. As a high-traffic area, this region has a larger population and population density than the other settlements in Chhukha. The exact town in the settlement that contains the border crossing, Phuentsholing, is represented by the densest pocket of roads in the settlement. Outside of Phuentsholing, there are two main roads in the settlement that split, travel around the settlement, and then rejoin at the northeast corner. This road leaves the main settlement, crosses through the entire subdivision, and ends at the northeast border of Chhukha. Along this road are six settlements that have populations of <2000 and low to medium density. This reflects the idea that settlements with smaller populations are often along roads to increase their accessibility. Plot 3 also shows three settlements that are not near the road system. These settlements lay along the southern border of Chhukha. While they are not near any mapped roads, these border settlements with low population (<2000) and density demonstrate the existance of smaller border crossings for the Bhutanese and Indians (who have different border crossing rights than other foreign nationals). Also mapped are the two health care facilities that were recorded in the files (represented by red plus signs). Chhukha has a relatively small population, so a low number of health care facilities was expected. One of these facilities exists along the main road within the second largest settlement in Chhukha. Because it exists along the main road, this facility is also accessible to the other northeastern settlements. The second healthcare facility exists in the largest settlement in Chhukha; however, it is not next to any mapped roads. This demonstrates that either local roads are not well-mapped in Bhutan or the healthcare facility was not properly mapped. The general pattern of roads and settlements existing in a line up the northeast of Chhukha makes sense within the context of its surrounding geographies. Northeast of Chhukha is the largest adm1 subdivision, Thimphu. The road mapped continues into the Thimphu adm1 and leads to the capital of Bhutan, also called Thimphu. This road allows humans to move from the main settlements in Chhukha to the capital Thimphu, the most urbanized area of Bhutan.
