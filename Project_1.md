# Project 1

## Geometric Bar Plot

On the left, plot 1 depits a map of Bhutan's adm1 subdivisions. Each subdivision is colored using a gradient to represent population size, as described by the legend "pop19". Each adm1 is labelled with its name and population density.
On the right, plot 1 uses a bar plot to illustrate the population size of each Bhutan adm1 subdivision. The x-axis represents population size and the y-axis contains each subdivision. The bars are labelled with the percentage of the total population and colored using a gradient to represent population size.

Plot 1 led me to deciding to focus in on the subdivision of Chhukha.
