Provide a written description of your selected household survey including the number of household and person observations as well as the variables in your source data.


Provide a written description of your spatially located households at the adm1 level of your selected location, including how you located each household, generated the household structure including demographic attributes of persons, and the percent error calculated. If you faced computational issues at the adm1 level when attempting to pivot from households to persons, describe those limitations.

Provide a written description of your spatially located households at the adm2 level of your selected location, again including how you located each household, generated the household structure including demographic attributes of persons, and the percent error calculated. Further analyze your synthetically generated households and persons with regard to percent error. Do you think this population is more or less accurate than the one generated at the adm1 level? What could you have done to improve your measures of accuracy?

When compared to a randomly generated synthetic population that describes the demographic attributes of households and persons, does yours more closely approximate reality? How is yours an improvement over a synthetic population that was generated in accordance with complete spatial randomness? Generate plots and incorporate results from your work as evidence in support of an argument that the synthetic population you generated is a good approximation of the reality that existed in your selected location at that given time.
